extensions.dnssec@nic.cz.description=Check DNSSEC security of domain names.
domain=Domain name 
nodomain=NNonexistence of the domain name 
0dnssecError=can not be verified by DNSSEC.
0dnssecErrorInfo=An error occurred while getting the DNSSEC status of this domain name. This may be caused by loss of connection to the DNS server or the user-chosen validating resolver IP address is not an address of a validating resolver.
1unsecuredDomain=is not secured by DNSSEC.
1unsecuredDomainInfo=This domain name is not secured by DNSSEC, so it is not possible to verify validity of obtained data and you are not secured against domain name spoofing.
2securedConnectionDomain=is correctly secured by DNSSEC.
2securedConnectionDomainInfo=Information about the IP address of this domain name was validated using DNSSEC. Because this domain name is secured by DNSSEC, you are protected against domain name spoofing.
3securedConnectionDomainInvIPaddr=is correctly secured by DNSSEC but browser's IP address is invalid.
3securedConnectionDomainInvIPaddrInfo=This domain name is secured by DNSSEC but the IP address which the browser is using differs from the address obtained by the DNSSEC add-on. This may have a legitimate reason but can also point at a DNS spoofing attempt!
4invalidDomainSignature=is secured by DNSSEC but invalid domain name signature has been detected!
4invalidDomainSignatureInfo=This domain name is secured by DNSSEC but invalid domain name signature has been detected. It could indicate spoofed domain name!
5unsecuredNoDomain=can not be verified with DNSSEC.
5unsecuredNoDomainInfo=The parent domain is not secured by DNSSEC, thus it was not possible to verify nonexistence of this domain name.
6securedConnectionNoDomain=was validated by DNSSEC.
6securedConnectionNoDomainInfo=The parent domain is secured by DNSSEC, thus it was possible to successfully verify nonexistence of this domain name.
7invalidNoDomainSignature=was not correctly validated by DNSSEC because invalid signature has been detected!
7invalidNoDomainSignatureInfo=The parent domain is secured by DNSSEC but the received domain name nonexistence response does not contain a valid signature. This may signalise a domain name spoofing attempt in order to deny the access to the domain.
