dnssec.connection.domain.secured=Your computer is also secured by DNSSEC for this particular domain, so you are secured against domain name spoofing.
dnssec.connection.domain.invipaddr.secured=Your computer is also secured by DNSSEC for this particular domain, but browser's and DNSSEC add-on's IP addresses of the server mismatch, so it could indicate spoofed domain name!
dnssec.connection.nodomain.secured=Your computer is also secured by DNSSEC for this particular domain, so you are secured against non-existent domain name spoofing.
dnssec.connection.nodomain.invipaddr.secured=Your computer is also secured by DNSSEC for this particular domain. However browser's IP address is probably spoofed, because inserted domain name does not exist!
dnssec.connection.invsigdomain.secured=Your computer is also secured by DNSSEC for this particular domain, but invalid domain name signature has been detected. It could indicate spoofed domain name!
dnssec.connection.invsigdomain.invipaddr.secured=Your computer is also secured by DNSSEC for this particular domain, but invalid domain name signature and invalid browser's IP address has been detected. It could indicate spoofed domain name!
dnssec.domain.signature.valid=But your computer is not secured by DNSSEC for this particular domain. Therefore authentication chain has not been established and domain name might be spoofed!
dnssec.auth.domain.signature.valid=But your resolver is authoritative DNS server for this domain name, so it cannot be validated by DNSSEC.
dnssec.invipaddr.domain.signature.valid=But your computer is not secured by DNSSEC for this particular domain. In addition browser's and DNSSEC add-on's IP addresses of the server mismatch, so it could indicate spoofed domain name!
dnssec.domain.signature.invalid=But your computer is not secured by DNSSEC for this particular domain. Domain name has invalid signature in addition, so it could indicate spoofed name!
dnssec.invipaddr.domain.signature.invalid=But your computer is not secured by DNSSEC for this particular domain. Domain name has invalid signature in addition, and browser's and DNSSEC add-on's IP addresses of the server mismatch, so it could indicate spoofed domain name!
dnssec.nodomain.signature.valid=But your computer is not secured by DNSSEC for this particular domain. Therefore authentication chain has not been established and domain name might actually exists!
dnssec.auth.nodomain.signature.valid=But your resolver is authoritative DNS server for this domain name, so its non-existence cannot be validated by DNSSEC.
dnssec.invipaddr.nodomain.signature.valid=But your computer is not secured by DNSSEC for this particular domain. In addition browser's IP address is probably spoofed, because inserted domain name apparently does not exist!
dnssec.nodomain.signature.invalid=But your computer is not secured by DNSSEC for this particular domain. In addition proof of domain name non-existence is not valid, so it probably indicates that domain name actually exists!
dnssec.invipaddr.nodomain.signature.invalid=But your computer is not secured by DNSSEC for this particular domain. In addition proof of domain name non-existence is not valid, therefore browser's IP address is probably spoofed!

dnssec.nodomain.unsecured=
dnssec.tooltip.secured=Secured by DNSSEC
