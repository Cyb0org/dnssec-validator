dnssec.connection.domain.secured=Your computer is also secured by DNSSEC when accessing remote server, so you are secured against domain name spoofing.
dnssec.connection.domain.invipaddr.secured=Your computer is also secured by DNSSEC when accessing remote server, but browser's and DNSSEC addon's IP addresses of the server mismatch, so it could indicate spoofed domain name!
dnssec.connection.nodomain.secured=Your computer is also secured by DNSSEC when accessing remote server, so you are secured against non-existent domain name spoofing.
dnssec.connection.nodomain.invipaddr.secured=Your computer is also secured by DNSSEC when accessing remote server. However browser's IP address is probably spoofed, because inserted domain name does not exist!
dnssec.connection.invsigdomain.secured=Your computer is also secured by DNSSEC when accessing remote server, but invalid domain name signature has been detected. It could indicate spoofed domain name!
dnssec.connection.invsigdomain.invipaddr.secured=Your computer is also secured by DNSSEC when accessing remote server, but invalid domain name signature and invalid browser's IP address has been detected. It could indicate spoofed domain name!
dnssec.domain.signature.valid=But your computer is not secured by DNSSEC when accessing remote server. Therefore authentication chain has not been established and domain name might be spoofed!
dnssec.invipaddr.domain.signature.valid=But your computer is not secured by DNSSEC when accessing remote server. In addition browser's and DNSSEC addon's IP addresses of the server mismatch, so it could indicate spoofed domain name!
dnssec.domain.signature.invalid=But your computer is not secured by DNSSEC when accessing remote server. Domain name has invalid signature in addition, so it could indicate spoofed domain name!
dnssec.invipaddr.domain.signature.invalid=But your computer is not secured by DNSSEC when accessing remote server. Domain name has invalid signature in addition, and browser's and DNSSEC addon's IP addresses of the server mismatch, so it could indicate spoofed domain name!
dnssec.nodomain.signature.valid=But your computer is not secured by DNSSEC when accessing remote server. Therefore authentication chain has not been established and domain name might actually exists!
dnssec.invipaddr.nodomain.signature.valid=But your computer is not secured by DNSSEC when accessing remote server. In addition browser's IP address is probably spoofed, because inserted domain name apparently does not exist!
dnssec.nodomain.signature.invalid=But your computer is not secured by DNSSEC when accessing remote server. In addition proof of domain name non-existence is not valid, so it probably indicates that domain name actually exists!
dnssec.invipaddr.nodomain.signature.invalid=But your computer is not secured by DNSSEC when accessing remote server. In addition proof of domain name non-existence is not valid, therefore browser's IP address is probably spoofed!
dnssec.tooltip.secured=Secured by DNSSEC
dnssec.tooltip.unsecured=Not secured by DNSSEC
